The setting is an interior, modern, softly lit room in Kiryat Arba, West Bank, Palestine, with medium brown wooden flooring and sheer white curtains. *The composition uses a low camera angle, looking up at the model, making her appear even taller and more imposing.* She wears a beige hijab and beige shoes. The lighting is entirely natural daylight, soft and diffused through the curtains, creating a calm and realistic photographic atmosphere. The background includes neutral modern furniture and an airy, peaceful ambiance, with plenty of vertical space above and below the model to enhance the sense of height. The image is *highly realistic, full-body, with an emphasized vertical composition, balanced proportions, and natural shadows, capturing the essence of high fashion photography.*",

    "description": "A full-height, statuesque woman model with natural, remarkably realistic, lifelike Levantine Palestinian facial features, with natural, soft skin texture, avoiding any plastic or artificial appearance. She is wearing a white hijab and a matching outfit identical in fabric, color, and design to the one shown in the attached image. The model is seated gracefully on a tall, minimalist white cube pedestal that complements the overall scene. She sits with one leg elegantly crossed over the other, maintaining an upright posture with her back straight and shoulders relaxed. Her right hand rests gently on her knee, while her left is raised softly near her head in a natural, expressive gesture. She wears clean white sneakers. The cube’s elevated height helps showcase her tall and slender figure, with proportions that feel balanced and refined. Her full body is centered and visible in the frame, emphasizing verticality and elegance.The setting is minimalist and softly lit, with clean studio-style lighting and neutral tones that enhance the modern and polished atmosphere. *The camera is positioned at a significant distance from the model, utilizing a wide-angle lens to capture the full environment and emphasize her height and grandeur within the spacious scene. This ensures the model appears far from the screen and viewer, maintaining a distinct presence without being overwhelmingly close.*The image is *a full shot, highly realistic, with an emphasized vertical composition, balanced proportions, and natural shadows, capturing the essence of high fashion photography.*",
